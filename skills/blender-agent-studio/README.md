# Blender Agent Studio

Describe what you want to make. Keep the Blender file and the Python that built it.

A Codex plugin for creating and refining Blender models, animations, and scenes.
It gives your agent workflows for the creative work, plus tools to inspect assets,
render them, and find textures.

## What you can do

- Build props, environments, characters, and Geometry Nodes setups.
- Gather references from several angles and compare the model's proportions before adding detail.
- Overlay projected geometry on a reference image, with optional silhouette-mask measurements for missing and excess coverage. See [reference modeling](docs/reference-modeling.md).
- Rig and animate models, or work with cloth, smoke, and other simulations.
- Render through your scene's cameras with its lighting intact, or use studio views to inspect a model from every side.
- Download CC0 textures and HDRIs from Poly Haven at 1K, 2K, 4K, or 8K.
- Check geometry and exported files, review renders, and repair what doesn't work.
- Query scene parts and evaluated dimensions, then check explicit geometry and ground constraints with the optional Rust runtime.

The plugin includes eleven specialist skills and a local MCP server for
inspection, rendering, and asset downloads. Generated scenes come with Python
source so you can rebuild them and keep making changes.

## Install

You'll need Codex with plugin support, [Bun](https://bun.sh), and Blender.
Blender 5.2 LTS is the tested version; use Bun 1.3.5 or newer.

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add ifBars/blender-agent-studio
codex plugin add blender-agent-studio@blender-agent-studio
```

Put `blender` on your `PATH`, or set `BLENDER_EXECUTABLE` to its location.
For example, in PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:BLENDER_EXECUTABLE = "C:\path\to\Blender\blender.exe"
```

Start a new Codex task after installing or updating the plugin.

For the optional scene-understanding tools, build the Rust runtime in the
installed plugin directory with `bun run setup:runtime`. See
[scene understanding](docs/scene-understanding.md) for setup, examples and
measurement limits. The existing tools do not require Rust.

<summary>Update an existing GitHub installation</summary>

```bash
codex plugin marketplace upgrade blender-agent-studio
codex plugin add blender-agent-studio@blender-agent-studio
```

## Try it

> Use Blender Agent Studio to build a walnut desk lamp. Give it warm lighting,
> render it from two angles, and save the .blend and Python source.

Include the style, dimensions, and intended use when they matter. For a game
asset, ask for a GLB export and a check that it imports correctly. For a render,
you can specify a camera angle, lighting, or reference image.

The [workflow guide](SKILL.md#route-the-request) covers modeling, rendering,
animation, characters, simulations, and more. You can also ask for a second
review of an existing scene.

## How well does it work?

The workflow includes visual review alongside file checks. Results still depend
on the model, the brief, and the scene.

In the 0.6 Astra tests, the revised workflow won the lantern comparison and lost
the workshop comparisons. See the [results and limits](plugins/blender-agent-studio/skills/blender-agent-benchmark/references/astra-0.6-validation.md)
and [benchmark methodology](plugins/blender-agent-studio/skills/blender-agent-benchmark/references/methodology.md).

Found a bug? [Open an issue](https://github.com/ifBars/blender-agent-studio/issues)
with your Blender version, what you asked for, and what happened. A render or
error log helps.

For code changes, see the [development guide](docs/development.md) and
[repository instructions](AGENTS.md). Keep generated models and benchmark output
out of commits. Review unfamiliar Blender scripts before running them; see
[security notes](SECURITY.md).
